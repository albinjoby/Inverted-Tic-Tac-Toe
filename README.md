### Project Description

An inverted Tic Tac Toe game where the AI deliberately tries to lose, and your challenge is to force it to accidentally win!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

What if AI was too good at losing? What if we needed to challenge players to outsmart an AI that's trying its best to avoid winning?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

A completely backwards Tic Tac Toe game where the AI uses reverse psychology and tries to lose, making it ironically harder for humans to win!
